<h1>Can nature heal you?</h1>
<p>
Having a connection with nature improves physical and mental health. Whether we only get 5 minutes of sunshine outside first thing in the morning or go on a strenuous 5-hour hike in the mountains, we thrive with the natural world. You could be totally sedentary and not have been active for years, and still benefit from going outside. Sunshine first thing in the morning has a biological and physiological effect on you; it has a purpose. Many of us get less and less sunshine, as society morphs into a tech-centered society. With Artificial Intelligence on the rise, and inevitable changes to life as we know it, we must keep our connection with nature. Let's not turn into the humans from Wall-E; hovering in our recliners with a holographic interface and screen; video chatting with the person right next to us. They were staying alive, but not really living. </p>

<h1>Sunshine is magical...</h1>
<p>Sunshine maintains or corrects our circadian rhythm; our internal clock that dictates our sleep patterns, hormone secretion, regeneration, blood pressure, body temperature, digestion, coordination, and strength. These rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral. We all know when we don't sleep well, our mind is not as alert and clear as we would like it to be. We can also be irritable until we have our cherished cup of coffee in the morning. Sunshine also creates the hormone Vitamin D in our system. Vitamin D aids our immune system, helps with sleep, bone health, mental health, muscle strength, hair health, and appetite. I'm a disabled veteran that has been following traditional Western medicine treatments for the past 13 years, without achieving lasting benefit. I am looking to test a theory I have: if I go outside for 5 minutes after waking up, I will start to see benefits and reduction in symptoms from my ailments. My drug-free prescriptions for a healthier self are: a dose of daily morning sunshine, a weekly hike or nature walk, and yoga practice twice a week. Follow my journey as I try to heal by reconnecting with nature and by practicing yoga.
